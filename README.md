**Summary:** I will attempt to cover several interrelated topics, spending more time on parts that resonate with the audience. I will introduce our recent study analyzing phenotypic data harvested from over 175 million unique patients. We use them to 1) estimate the heritability and familial environmental patterns of diseases, and 2) infer the genetic and environmental correlations between disease pairs from a set of complex diseases. I am particularly interested in inferring objective classifications of diseases (based on a formal optimization criterion), separately from environmental and genetic factors. I will then show how the same data can be used for spatial analysis of disease prevalence (with several examples, including “many Americas” analysis in medications use). Finally, I will give an example of practical application of computational analysis (asthma and sepsis story).
